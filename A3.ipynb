The average training cross-entropy loss measures how well the network is able to minimize the difference between predicted and actual output during training.\n","\n","The general intuition behind the relationship between the number of hidden units and average training cross-entropy loss is as follows:\n","\n","1. Fewer hidden units: If the network has a small number of hidden units, it may have limited capacity to capture the complexity of the underlying data. In this case, the network may struggle to learn the patterns and relationships in the data, leading to a higher training loss. The model may underfit the data, resulting in lower accuracy and higher loss values.\n","\n","2. Optimal number of hidden units: There is typically an optimal number of hidden units that allows the network to effectively learn the patterns in the data without overfitting. This optimal number can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. Increasing the number of hidden units beyond this optimal point may not provide significant improvement in performance and can potentially lead to overfitting.\n","\n","3. Too many hidden units: If the network has an excessively large number of hidden units, it may have excessive capacity and may start to memorize the training examples instead of learning the underlying patterns. This can lead to overfitting, where the network performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to unseen data. In such cases, the training loss may be very low, indicating good performance on the training set, but the model may perform poorly on new data.\n","\n","Everytime we re-run the above code, it outputs a different graph, sometimes shows that the average accuracy decreases as number of hidden units increases, soemtimes shows that the average accuracy decreases from increasing 5 hidden units to 20 but increases from 20 to 40 hidden units. And there are other results as well.\n","\n","This depends on several parameters in the trained model, especially when initial weights is up to random in intervals [0, 0.1]."],"metadata":{"id":"2O5mHUwN343z"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Task 3: Classification Quality Evaluation**\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ADH850e59vWs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Part a:**\n","We explore how the size of the training data set affects the test and train accuracy.

However, it's important to note that since the initial weights are randomly assigned, everytime we rerun the model it will churn out a different optimal combinations. \n","\n","However, the general ideas are that:\n","\n","1. Hidden Units: The number of hidden units determines the capacity or complexity of the model. Increasing the number of hidden units can increase the model's ability to capture complex patterns in the data, potentially leading to improved accuracy. However, using too many hidden units can also result in overfitting if the model becomes too complex for the given dataset.\n","\n","2. Learning Rate: The learning rate controls the step size at which the model's weights are updated during training. A higher learning rate can result in faster convergence during training, but it may also cause the model to overshoot the optimal solution and lead to instability or divergence. On the other hand, a lower learning rate may result in slower convergence but can potentially lead to better accuracy if the model is able to find a more precise solution.\n","\n","3. Dropout Rate: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out a fraction of the neurons during training. It helps prevent overfitting by reducing the interdependence of neurons and promoting better generalization. A higher dropout rate can increase the model's ability to generalize but may also lead to underfitting if too many neurons are dropped. Conversely, a lower dropout rate may result in more overfitting if the model relies heavily on specific neurons.\n","\n","4. Batch Size: The batch size determines the number of samples processed before the model's weights are updated during training. A larger batch size can provide a smoother gradient estimation, leading to more stable updates and potentially faster convergence. However, using a larger batch size requires more memory, and the model may get stuck in suboptimal solutions. Smaller batch sizes can introduce more stochasticity and exploration during training, potentially leading to better accuracy, but they may also result in slower convergence.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"qL8X11sM7ijq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Part c:**\n","\n","Report and compare your NB, kNN, SVM and NN classifiers with the best hyperparameter\n","settings.
